                                    agents. Not only is she the No. 1 agent in Hinsdale, Illinois,
                                    but she also leads the No. 1 ranked team in lllinois and the
                                    Midwest, and No. 4 in the nation among all brokerages, as
                                    ranked by the Wall Street Journal Real Trends. Since
                                    expanding seven years ago, the Dawn McKenna Group
                                    (DMG) holds the number one position in Southwest Florida,
                                    Park City, Utah, and Inman named DMG the number one
                                    luxury team in the United States in 2023.

                                    Dawn's success led to her being invited to be a founding
                                    member of two exclusive, invite-only agent networks: the

                        <p>Energetic, youthful, and service-oriented approach, Dawn's record performance has been recognized by the Wall Street Journal,
                            RealTrends rankings, Forbes, and Crain's Chicago Business. When her clients demanded help in new markets, Dawn bet that her
                            unique model could be replicated and, in 2016, formed the Dawn Mckenna Group. Choosing agents that match Dawn's qualities but
                            bring their own local expertise to a carefully selected group of new destination and feeder markets, Dawn created a growing,
                            recognizable brand with 30 team members in eight offices servicing six states. with the addition of industry veterans Micheal
                            Anthony, Bernadette Kettwig, and in-house marketing, photography, and social media teams, the DMG is now a national leader in
                            residential real estate.</p>
                        <p>

                            With a strategy of pairing global reach with local experts in feeder and destination markets, the DMG expanded to North Michigan
                            Avenue in Chicago's Gold Coast (2017) and prestigious sth Avenue in Naples, Florida (2017). Success soon followed, as did requests
                            for help in more places. So, next up for DMG offices were the exclusive North Shore of Chicago suburbs of Winnetka and Lake Forest
                            (2019), and the prestigious vacation/second home markets of Harbor Country, Michigan/indiana (2022), Park City, Utah (2023), and
                            Lake Geneva, Wisconsin (2023).

                            them find the perfect Chicago or Naples rental. With DMG Rentals, the DMG serves its clients in all the stages of their ives, from their
